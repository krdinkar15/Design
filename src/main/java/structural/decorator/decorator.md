### Decorator Design Pattern :

Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. 
Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.



##### problem : 
You want to add behavior or state to individual objects at run-time. 
Inheritance is not feasible because it is static and applies to an entire class.
